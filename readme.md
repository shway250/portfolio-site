#Routing those Views

Create a 3-5 page front-end app using Angular. This could be a portfolio site, an extension of the Star Wars assignment, or anything else you want to make. The main goals are to ensure that you understand the angular router, and to solidify your understanding of `$scope`, controllers, directives, and templates.

Feel free to play with different directives and style the site appropriately.
